Hi! I'm Saida, a 17-year old computer science ethusiast :) Coming from a community where CS education wasn't accessible to many students and transitioning to the complete opposite of that in Phillips Academy, I decided to create this blog. I've just started, but stay tuned for more simple and funny posts!
