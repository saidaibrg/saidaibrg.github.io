Imagine you’re a startup business owner, and to increase your sales, you need to complete the following tasks as soon as possible:
* Read through every Amazon review about the product
* Analyze the feedback from a recently filled-out survey by ~50000 customers 
* Look through your company’s tag and comments on Instagram, and analyze that feedback about them. 

Imagine yourself in the midst of a pandemic (not so hard, right?^). You can’t go outside, all your friends and relatives are busy, but you feel upset and really need some emotional support.

**What would you do in both of these cases?** 

Well, no matter what your answer is. A special technique in NLP, called *SENTIMENT ANALYSIS* could be of big help. 

### A sentiment analysis is a technique in NLP that is used to analyze the emotion of a particular text.Nowadays, it’s used quite a lot for customer support and marketing services, and some of its applications include: monitoring of social media, mental health research, analysis of customer feedback, improvement of chatbots and voice assistants, market and competitors and research and more! 

Although its “for-good” applications aren’t that widespread, a good amount of [research](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V7/i7/IRJET-V7I7914.pdf) is being conducted in that field as well.

Conducting sentiment analysis is tricky, especially considering the fact that humans themselves sometimes can’t precisely understand the sentiment of a particular text. Think about sarcasm, irony, metaphors… Nonetheless, when used properly, effective sentiment analysis can lead to so much progress and efficiency in various spheres.

More specifically, this NLP technique can be implemented in the following ways: 
* Through a [rule-based method](https://saidaibrg.github.io/Sentiment-Analysis/)
* With the help of Machine Learning (more specifically Neural Networks!)
* Through a hybrid method that combines both Rules and ML
