#### Imagine you’re a startup business owner and, in order to increase your sales, you need to complete the following tasks:
* Read through every Amazon review about your product
* Analyze the feedback from a recently filled-out survey by ~50000 customers 
* Look through your company’s tags and comments on Instagram and analyze that feedback. 

#### Imagine yourself in the midst of a pandemic (not so hard to do, right?^). You can’t go outside, all your friends and relatives are busy, but you feel upset and really need some emotional support.

**What would you do in both of these cases?** 

Well, no matter what your answer is, a special technique in NLP, called *sentiment analysis* could be of big help. 

### A sentiment analysis is a technique in NLP that is used to analyze the emotion in text. Nowadays, it’s used quite a lot for customer support and marketing services. 
Some of its applications include: monitoring of social media, mental health research, analysis of customer feedback, improvement of chatbots and voice assistants, market and competitors and research and more! 

Although its “for-good” applications aren’t that widespread, a good amount of [research](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V7/i7/IRJET-V7I7914.pdf) is being conducted in that field as well.

Conducting sentiment analysis is tricky, especially because humans themselves sometimes can’t precisely understand the sentiment of a particular text. Think about sarcasm, irony, metaphors. Nonetheless, when used properly, effective sentiment analysis can lead to a lot of progress and efficiency in various spheres. 

More specifically, this NLP technique can be implemented in the following ways: 
* Through a [rule-based method](https://saidaibrg.github.io/Sentiment-Analysis/)
* With the help of Machine Learning (more specifically Neural Networks!)
* Through a hybrid method that combines both Rules and ML
