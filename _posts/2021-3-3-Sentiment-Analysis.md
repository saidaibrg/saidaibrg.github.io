How to Analyse Text Sentiment Without Neural Networks? 

As previously discussed[link], sentiment analysis algorithms can be conducted in 3 main ways: through a rule-based approach, an autonomous (machine learning) approach, and a hybrid program that combines both approaches. Although the sentiment analysis is the NLP technique, one of the above methods doesn't require the use of NLP at all. Those systems of rules are usually handcrafted by humans, so a programmer themselves decides on what "filters" they want for their system. 

But usually, the first step in this process is something known as **tokenization.** If you've done any programming before and worked with data structures, you are likely familiar with the problem of splitting a string containing sentences into substrings containing only one word. This is exactly what happens during tokenization. Depending on the **delimiter**, the input string will turn into a sequence of **tokens** that are then analyzed separately.

Once the string of data is separated, the program moves on to the clean-up process that consists of the usage of **stopwords**, **lemmatization**, and **stemming**.
